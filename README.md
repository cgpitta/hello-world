learning to create a repository 
Hello! My name is Carolyn and I just finished my graduate degree in computer information systems. During my program, I focused on learning how to program as well as develop a solid database foundation. I took two courses in Object Oriented Programming using C++, Programming for Data Analytics using python and pandas libraries, and data warehousing coursework. I'm excited to continue my technical journey!
